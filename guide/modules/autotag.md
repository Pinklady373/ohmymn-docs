# AutoTag

Specified tags are automatically added if a regex is matched, and specific content can also be extracted from the excerpt as tags.

## Custom

::: warning Input Format
[replace() Function Format —— Extract](../custom.md#replace-function)
:::

**Example**

- `(/./, "This is an example")` and you can add a label for "This is an example" each time.

## [MagicAction for Card](magicaction4card.md#add-tag)

### Add Tag

::: warning Input Format
[replace() Function Format —— Extract](../custom.md#replace-function)

Since in most cases it's just to add tags without extracting them, you can just type in the tag content and I'll complete it as `(/./, "标签")`.
