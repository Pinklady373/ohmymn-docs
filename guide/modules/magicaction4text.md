# MagicAction for Text

The actions here are related to the selected text, which mostly just copy the result to the clipboard. After selecting the text, click the button to search or copy the selected text. Not only text, but also a selected area can be used, even for formula OCR.

## More Pop-up Options

I do not know if you have noticed, when you select a piece of excerpt in the document, followed by the hand tool to select a paragraph of text, the menu will display `Set Title` , `Add as Comment`, and other options. This will allow you to select the text directly as the title or comments added to the previously selected excerpt.

OhMyMN takes advantage of this feature. When you select a piece of excerpt in a document, immediately use the hand tool to select a piece of text, and then execute the action , certain actions that copy the result of the execution to the clipboard will pop up more options, such as "set title", “merge title”, and “set as comment”, etc.
