# MN Tips

### Hand Tool, Text Tool, Rectangular Tool & Lasso Tool

Just like PhotoShop's selection tools, MN has a number of selection tools that let you select and excerpt an area or text in a document. Except for the hand tools, other tools will automatically excerpt contents after selection.

I usually use the hand tool. Dragging a selection area into the mindmap will automatically excerpt and create the card. This also allows you to control the position of the card.

When using the other three selection tools, the `Auto Add to MindMap` function is enabled. The automatic insertion position is set to `Auto Insertion Position` so that you can quickly make batch excerpts and create a mindmap.

### Drag & Drop

In the Home Screen of MN, there is an entry of `Drag selection to MindMap`. When you drag the selected area A into the mindmap and drop it onto an existing card B, there are 2 options:

1. Card A will become a child node of card B.
2. Card A will be merged into card B.

There are pros and cons for each of the options. `Add as Child` is convenient for excerpting and managing mindmap structures. Use [AutoStyle](modules/autostyle.md) to automatically set the same color for cards at the same level. `Merge into` is more important in OhMyMN. Together with [AutoTitle](modules/anotherautotitle.md), [AutoDef](modules/anotherautodef.md), and other modules that can generate titles, it is also possible to turn new excerpts into titles and continue merging them, which utilizes the title links.

You may wonder if it is possible to do both. Actually, there is. When you drag and drop a selection onto a selection that has already been excerpted from the document, it will merge them directly even if you set it to `Add as Child`.
